I am a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> Ph.D. candidate working on Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence.

I'm advised by <a href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/"><b>Professor Silvio Savarese</b></a> in <a href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/"><b>Computational Vision and Geometry Lab</b></a> in <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu"><b>Stanford AI Group</b></a>. Before joining Professor Savarese's group, I worked with <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/"><b>Professor Steven Boyd</b></a> on the parallel inference on MRF using Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM) and <a href="http://geometry.stanford.edu"><b>Professor Leonidas Guibas</b></a> on shapes analysis using the Graph Laplacian.

Currently, Iâ€™m working as a teaching assistance for the Computer Vision (CS231A) and made the class website <a href="http://cs231a.stanford.edu/">link</a>.

In 2014, I worked as the Student Organizer/Web-Master for the Bay Area Vision Meeting and made the website <a href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/BAVM14">link</a>. 

Before coming to Stanford, I worked in <a href="http://slsp.kaist.ac.kr/">Statistical Learning and Signal Processing Lab</a> in Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology as an undergraduate researcher when I was a senior. I worked on speech recognition using Semi-Markov Model (an extension of a Hidden Markov Model that has edges going back to distant past).
