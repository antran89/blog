Hello, I’m <b>Christopher Bongsoo Choy</b>. I’m pursuing Ph.D. at <a
target="_blank" href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> and
interested in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

I'm advised by <a href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/silvio/"><b>Professor Silvio
Savarese</b></a> in the <a href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/"><b>Computational
Vision and Geometry Lab</b></a> in the <a
href="http://ai.stanford.edu"><b>Stanford AI Group</b></a>. Before joining
Professor Savarese's group, I worked with <a
href="http://www.stanford.edu/~boyd/"><b>Professor Steven Boyd</b></a> on the
parallel inference on MRF using the <a
href="http://stanford.edu/~boyd/admm.html">Alternating Direction Method of
Multiplier (ADMM)</a> and <a href="http://geometry.stanford.edu"><b>Professor
Leonidas Guibas</b></a> on shapes analysis using the Graph Laplacian.

Currently, I’m working as a teaching assistance for the Computer Vision class
(CS231A) and made the class <a href="http://cs231a.stanford.edu/">website</a>.

In 2014 summer, I worked as the Student Organizer/Web-Master for the Bay Area
Vision Meeting and made the <a
href="http://cvgl.stanford.edu/BAVM14">website</a>. 

Before coming to Stanford, I worked in the <a
href="http://slsp.kaist.ac.kr/">Statistical Learning and Signal Processing
Lab</a> in the <a href="www.kaist.ac.kr"><b>Korea Advanced Institute of Science
and Technology(KAIST)</b></a> as an undergraduate researcher when I was a
senior. I worked on speech recognition using the Semi-Markov Model (an
extension of a Hidden Markov Model that has edges going back to the distant
past).

I went to [Korea Science
Academy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Science_Academy_of_KAIST)(highschool)
from 2004-2007. A third of graduates are now pursuing Ph.D. degree and 3 of my
friends went there together are now Ph.D.’s at Stanford.
