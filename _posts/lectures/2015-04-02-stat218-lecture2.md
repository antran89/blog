## A Compound Poisson Distribution

$X_i$ i.i.d. cdf $F$ with mean $\mu$

independent of $X_i$ and $N \sim Poisson(\lambda)$ Let $W = \sum_{i=1}^N X_i$ then $W$ is said to have compound Poisson distribution.

$$
\begin{align}
EW & = E[E[W|N]]\\
& = E[\mu N]\\
& = \mu \lambda
\end{align}
$$

Since each $X_i$ has the mean of $\mu$.

### Moment Generating Function of $W$

$\phi_W(t) = E e^{tW}$

We can calculate $E(W^\alpha) = \phi_W^{(\alpha)}(0)$ where $\cdot^{(\alpha)}$ is $\alpha$ th derivative.

Coming back to the original problem. By conditioning on the number $N$, we get

$$
\begin{align}
\phi_W(t) & = E e^{tW} \\
& = E[ E[ e^{t \sum X_i} | N ]]\\
& = E[ \phi_X^N (t)]
\end{align}
$$

Thus,

$$
\begin{align}
E(W^\alpha) & = \sum_n^\infty \phi_X^n(t) \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^n}{\lambda !} \\
& = e^{-\lambda} e^{\lambda \phi_X(t)}
\end{align}
$$

The mean and variance of the R.V $W$ can be easiliy computed by taking derivative of the M.G.F.

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt} \phi(t) & = \exp{\lambda [\phi_x(t) - 1]} \lambda \phi_X’(t)
\end{align}
$$

The M.G.F of a Poisson R.V. can be easily computed by setting $X_i = 1$ and  $\phi_X(t) = e^t$.


## Renewal (or Counting) Processes

$X_i$ s i.i.d. and non-negative R.V.s with cdf $F$. (think “failure times”)

$S_0 = 0$ and $S_n = \sum_{i = 1}^nX_i$ = times until $n$ th failure.

Let $N(t)=$ number of events (or failure) by time $t$ (and including $t$).

<div class="notice">
Def: any random function $N(t)$ satisfying<br>

	- $N(t) \ge 0$<br>
	- $N(t)$ is  integer-valued<br>
	- $N(s) \le N(t) $ if $s \le t$</br>
	- ifd $s \lt t$, $N(t) - N(s)$ is the number of events occuring in $(s,t]$<br>

is a counting process
</div>


<div class="notice">
Def: A counting process is <br>

	- said to have independent incerements if number of events occuring in disjoint intervals are independent<br>
	- said to have stationary increments if the distribution of number of events in any interval only depends on its length.<br>
</div>

<div class="notice">
Def: $N(t)$ is a Poisson process with rate $\lambda$ where $\lambda \gt 0)$ if <br>

	- $N(0) = 0$<br>
	- process has independent increments<br>
	- number of events in $(s,t] \sim Poisson( \lambda( t- s))$<br>
</div>

The definition provided is not really constructive. A more general way to define a Poisson process is

$X_i$ i.i.d. $exponential(\lambda)$i.e. density $\lambda e^{-\lambda t}$.

$N(t) = $ number of failure by time $t$.
