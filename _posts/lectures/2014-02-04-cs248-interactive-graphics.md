# CS248 Interactive Graphics

I took the class 2013-2014 winter quarter

I generally liked the class except the project part which requires a student to make a game using Unity engine. I made a mobile game which wasnâ€™t really helpful unless you want to make an application.

These are the homeworks. The code they provided only use glut so I decided to make my own homework framework and used shader languages for fun.
