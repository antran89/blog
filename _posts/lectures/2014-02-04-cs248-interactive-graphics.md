I took the class during 2013-2014 winter quarter.

These are homework submissions that I made. The starter codes they provided only used GLUT with no shader programs so I decided to make my own homework framework and used shader languages for fun.

My framework used C++/OpenGL4.1/GLFW3. I wanted to used OpenGL4.3 but Mac OSX at that time used 4.1 and I didn’t want to break any Mac packages so I just used 4.1 functionalities. If you use 4.3, you can use more shader functions.

This is the one that I didn’t use my framework. The GLUT boxes are ugly but since I was more interested in implementing Inverse Jacobian, I used the starter kit from the class.
