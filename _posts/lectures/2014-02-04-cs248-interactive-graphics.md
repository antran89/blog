# CS248 Interactive Graphics

I took the class 2013-2014 winter quarter

I generally liked the class except the project part which required a student to make a game using Unity engine. I made a mobile game which wasn’t really helpful since I was more interested in OpenGL and Graphics background.

These are homework submissions that I made. The starter codes they provided only use glut and no shader so I decided to make my own homework framework and used shader languages for fun.

My framework used C++/OpenGL4.1/GLFW3. I wanted to used OpenGL4.3 at that time but the Mac OSX at that time uses 4.1 and I didn’t want to break any Mac packages so I just used 4.1 functionalities. If you use 4.3, you can use more shader functions.

This is the one that I didn’t use my framework. The GLUT boxes are ugly but since I was more interested in implementing Inverse Jacobian, I used the starter kit from the class.
