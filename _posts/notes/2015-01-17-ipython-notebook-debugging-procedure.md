Ipython notebook is very convenient since it allows to run a portion of a code yet debugging is very inconvenient. The debugging procedure that Iâ€™m using is combination of ipython + qtconsoel + pdb.

When you first open qtconsole using the line magic function `%qtconsole` on ipython notebook, it provides interactive console window. Yet this does not allow putting break point on the code. Instead you can enable pdb calling using `%pdb` line magic function. For example, in ipython notebook or the qtconsole connected to the notebook type `%pdb`.

You can use interactive pdb to print variables, run python commands or use all standard pdb commands (step, up, down, clear, break, quit).
Once you are done, you can switch off the automatic pdb calling mode by typing `%pdb` again.
