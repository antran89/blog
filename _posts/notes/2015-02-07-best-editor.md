I used to use Sublime Text editor but switched back to *vim* since I like to work home and thus I had to work through *ssh*. Probably, the vim might be the only choice. So the only option I had was to use vim. 

One of my friends keeps telling me that the vim is the editor out of its era, but I canâ€™t find alternative for *tmux + vim* through *ssh*. However, for most programmers, the sublime text is gaining a lot of momentum right now and more plugins for it will sway my mind <http://www.slant.co/topics/12/~what-are-the-best-programming-text-editors>
