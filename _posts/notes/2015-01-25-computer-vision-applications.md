List of computer vision applications that will change the world.

1. Driverless Car

    Yes, the most well known computer vision application. The driverless car must aware of the situation around it and understands traffic signals, pedestrians, lanes and road signs.

    Current version of driverless car heavily rely on the laser scanner (Velodyne LiDAR scanner) but computer vision parts must be incorporated to detect lanes, traffic signals and road signs (Laser scan is too sparse to detect these reliably)


2. Trash Sorting

    Currently most of trash sorting in the disposal facility has been automated. However, separating plastic from the light trash still cause great difficulty and many facilities use manual labors for the job.

    A company called Sadako Technology is trying to develop a system that sort trash automatically.

3. Face Recognition

    It is well known application. All cameras can detect human face. However, face identification is a new challenge which is famously adopted in *iPhoto* and *Facebook*. Yet there is another great personal face identification application called *Peeple*which identifies people and can be placed on a door to notify residents.
