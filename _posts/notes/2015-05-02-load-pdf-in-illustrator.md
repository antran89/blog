Importing LaTeX compiled pdf files sometimes fail because of missing LaTeX
fonts. In that case, follow the procedure below to convert the pdf files into
vector graphics (including all texts) to import fonts as vector graphics[^1].

- Click “Edit”, then click “Place” to load a PDF page.
- Select the loaded page and click “Object” and select “Flatten Transparency”.
- On the pop up menu, check “Convert All Text as Outlines”
