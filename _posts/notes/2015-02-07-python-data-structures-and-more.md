When you are working with fairly large amount of growing data, the internal mechanism of the data structures affect the performance of your program. Recently, Iâ€™m working on synthetic data generation for neural network training and the growing size of data can be a source of problem since simple `append` on a `list` could copy all the data everytime the size changes.

I found nice articles summarizing the internal mechanisms of the python `list` and `dictionary` data structures.

The list can keep a pointer to a datum if it is immutable and works similarly to `vector` in C++. The dictionary uses *open addressing* hashing to create a hash table and saves pointers to the data.

Many more data-structures are also available and a nice article summarized in a list <http://kmike.ru/python-data-structures/>
