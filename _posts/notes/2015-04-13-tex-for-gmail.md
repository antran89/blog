Found an awesome browser extension called **Tex for Gmail**. Once you install
this, you can read your email with compiled TeX math equations using MathJax.
One you go to the gmail (not inbox), you can see the added **Tex for Gmail**
options on the left as usual gmail categories. This app is available on chrome,
firefox, safari and opera.

That is not the end, when you are composing an email, **Tex for Gmail** will
convert the math equations (including inline) into images embedded on the
email!

Last, you can convert the math images back to LaTeX equations by selecting and
doubl-clicking the images.
