I found an awesome browser extension called **Tex for Gmail**. Once you install
it, you can read your email with compiled TeX math equations using MathJax.
If you go to the gmail (inbox is not supported yet), you can see the added
**Tex for Gmail** options on the left that looks just like the other usual
gmail categories. This application is available on chrome, firefox, safari and
opera.

That is not the end of the story. When you are composing an email, **Tex for
Gmail** will convert math equations (including inline equations) into images
embedded in the email!

Last, you can convert the math images back to LaTeX equations by selecting and
double-clicking the images.
