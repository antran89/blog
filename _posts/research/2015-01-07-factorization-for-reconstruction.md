Extracting shape and motion from a video can be simply solved using various techniques. The most famous method is Tomasi-Kanade algorithm where you factorize a coordinate of feature points in a sequence of frame into shape and motion matrices. The idea is strikingly simple yet elegant.


### Tomasi-Kanade Algorithm

Suppose you have a $F$ frames of track of $P$ points. Each point being a $u,v$ pair indicating $x$ coordinate and $y$ coordinate respectively and $f$ be the frame index and $p$ be the point index $(u_f^p, v_f^p)$. Then we model the camera as an orthographic projection camera.

$$
M_f = 
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
i_f\\
j_f
\end{array}
\right]
$$

where $i,j \in \mathcal{R}$ being the unit vector pointing along $x$ and $y$ axes respectively. Then the camera projection ray is $k_f = i_f \times j_f$.


#### Stacking $U,V$.

First, we define a large matrix that concatenate $u$ and $v$ coordinate

$$
W =
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
u_1^T \\
v_1^T \\
u_2^T \\
v_2^T \\
\vdots \\
u_F^T \\
v_F^T
\end{array}
\right]
$$

The $u_f, v_f \in \mathcal{R}^{P}$ are concatenated $x,y$ coordinates of $p$th point in $f$ the frame.

#### Center Points

To prevent singular vectors affected by the centroid of the data points, letâ€™s first center the point by subtracting the mean of the points for each frame from the data.

$$
\tilde{W} = 
\left[
\begin{array}{c}
\tilde{u}_1^T \\
\tilde{v}_1^T \\
\tilde{u}_2^T \\
\tilde{v}_2^T \\
\vdots \\
\tilde{u}_F^T \\
\tilde{v}_F^T
\end{array}
\right]
$$

Where $\tilde{u}\_{if} = u\_{if} - \sum\_{j=1}^Pu\_{jf}$ and $\tilde{v}\_{if} = v\_{if} - \sum\_{j=1}^Pv_{jf}$

#### Factorization


Finally we can factorize the points and the affine camera matrix using Singular Value Decomposition.

$$
\begin{align}
\tilde{W} & = MS\\
& = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
M_1\\
M_2\\
\vdots \\
M_F
\end{array}
\right]
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
s_1 & s_2 & \dots & s_P
\end{array}
\right]
\end{align}
$$

The matrix $M_f  = [i_f^T j_f^T]^T \in \mathcal{R}^{2 \times 3}$ where $i_f$ and $j_f$ are vectors for camera reference frame axes and $s_p \in \mathcal{R}^3$ is the world coordinate of the point. Using singular value decomposition, one can factorize the matrix $\tilde{W}$ into $U \Sigma V^T$ where singular values on $\Sigma$ are sorted in decreasing order. For noisy observation, the matrix $\tilde{W}$ would be a full rank matrix. Thus, we use best approximation of the observation by taking the rank-3 approximation of the measurement which is $\tilde{W} \approx \sum_{i=1}^3 \sigma_i u_i  v_i^T$

More formally,

$$
\begin{align}
\tilde{W} & = U\Sigma V^T \\
& = 
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
U_1 & U_2
\end{array}
\right] 
\left[ \begin{array}{cc}
\Sigma_1 & 0 \\
0 & \Sigma_2 \end{array}\right]
\left[ \begin{array}{c}
V_1^T\\
V_2^T
\end{array}\right]\\

 & = U_1 \Sigma_1  V_1^T + U_2 \Sigma_2 V_2^T\\
 & \approx U_1 \Sigma_1  V_1^T \\
 & = \left(U_1 \Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}} \right) \left( \Sigma^{\frac{1}{2}} V_1^T \right)\\
 & = M S
\end{align}
$$

The factorization is not unique and for arbitrary invertible matrix $Q$, $MQ$ and $Q^{-1}S$ also satisfy the observations.

Thus, we further constrain the problems so that axes of a frame $f$ are orthonormal vectors.

$$
\begin{align}
i_f^T Q Q^T i_f & = 1\\
j_f^T Q Q^T j_f & = 1\\
i_f^T Q Q^T j_f & = 0
\end{align}
$$

The $Q$ can be found by fitting data and the solution is unique up to a rotation.
