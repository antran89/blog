While I was making a lecture note for CS231A on Bag of Words for recogntion, I wanted to include few intuitive explanations about why clustering works but can’t support mathematically so I browse through some papers and found a really nice article about the subject.[^1] [^2]

## Samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution

In high dimensional space, samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution would create a shell rather than a sphere since most of the mass is concentrated on the skin.

[^1] varied the distance metric and performed standard k-means clustering and measured the classification accuracy. 

> distance metrics with high norm parameters
> to be poorly discriminating between the furthest and nearest neighbor

## Samples from a uniform distribution in a hyper-cube

In high dimensional space, samples drawn from a uniform hyber-cube distribution will mostly fall closer to a face of hyper-cube than it’s nearest neighbor!
