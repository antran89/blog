## Samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution

In high dimensional space, samples from a multivariate Gaussian distribution would create a shell rather than a sphere since most of the mass is concentrated on the skin.

[^1] varied the distance metric and performed standard k-means clustering and measured the classification accuracy.

## Samples from a uniform distribution in a hyper-cube

In high dimensional space, samples drawn from a uniform hyper-cube distribution will mostly fall closer to a face of hyper-cube than itâ€™s nearest neighbor!
