A rendering engine is a key component for 3D-2D registration or many 3D reasoning of computer vision.

Many available rendering applications were either difficult to use or heavy and difficult to install. To overcome these, I made an open source rendering engine that can be used in MATLAB or Python.

[https://github.com/chrischoy/OSGRenderer](https://github.com/chrischoy/OSGRenderer)

The rendering engine require OpenSceneGraph which can be easily installed using `apt-get` or `brew`. If someone wants to use the up-to-date Openscenegraph, I recommend installing from [https://github.com/openscenegraph/osg](https://github.com/openscenegraph/osg).

The renderer has MATLAB and Python interfaces. The usage and install instructions are on the README page of my github OSGRenderer page https://github.com/chrischoy/OSGRenderer.
